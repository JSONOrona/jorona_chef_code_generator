Functional and Unit Tests
-------------------------

This cookbook is set up to run tests under Test Kitchen. It uses serverspec to run integration tests after the node has been converged to verify that the state of the node.

Test kitchen should run completely without exception using the default baseboxes provided by Chef. Because Test Kitchen creates VirtualBox machines and runs through every configuration in the .kitchen.yml file, it may take some time for these tests to complete.

If your changes are only for a specific recipe, run only its configuration with Test Kitchen. If you are adding a new recipe, or other functionality such as a LWRP or definition, please add appropriate tests and ensure they run with Test Kitchen.

If any don't pass, investigate them before submitting your update.

Any new feature should have unit tests included with the patch with good code coverage to help protect it from future changes. Similarly, patches that fix a bug or regression should have a regression test. Simply put, this is a test that would fail without your patch but passes with it. The goal is to ensure this bug doesn't regress in the future.


Cookbook Contribution Do's and Don't's
--------------------------------------

* Please do include tests for your contribution.

* Please do use foodcritic to lint-check the cookbook.

* Please do ensure that your changes do not break or modify behavior for other platforms supported by the cookbook.

* Please do not modify the version number in the metadata.rb, the jenkins job will bump the version for you and tag it appropriately


Linting/Checkstyle commands
---------------------------

You can automatically have these run upon git commit with a hook.

There is a git pre-commit hook setup automatically unless you don't have git setup on this box.
if you did in fact generate without git init then you will need to symlink and add execute permissions to the hook.
Symlink `hooks/pre-commit` -> to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

To ignore the pre-commit hook add --no-verify to the commit. Try not to do this.
